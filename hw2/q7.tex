\begin{question}[3]
Please review this article discussed in recitation: \textit{This Navigation App Keeps You Out of High-crime Areas in Real Time},\\ \url{https://www.androidauthority.com/redzone-navigation-app-avoids-high-crime-areas-686894/}.

\begin{subquestion}[1]
Let's assume this navigation app uses A* search with an admissible and consistent heuristic to find and return paths.
Suppose you are working on this app, and your boss proposes a new heuristic.
There is some crime rate metric that ranges from 0 to 5, where 5 is high crime. 
Your boss proposes that you add this crime rate metric to the application's current heuristic, such that \textbf{the heuristic is still admissible and consistent.}

%Describe the impact this will this have on the path that is returned. Give your answer in one sentence.[
Will the path \textbf{necessarily} change with the new heuristic? If so, will the new path be optimal? If not, under what conditions would the path change?

\begin{subquestion}[1]
If for some reason you choose not to adjust the heuristic, what is one way your implementation could return paths that avoid high crime areas? Give your answer in one sentence.
