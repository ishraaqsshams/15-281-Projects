\begin{problem}{Search Nodes}

Consider the tree search (i.e. no explored set) of an arbitrary search problem with max branching factor $b$. Each search node $n$ has a backward (cumulative) cost of $g(n)$, an admissible heuristic of $h(n)$, and a depth of $d(n)$. Let $n_c$ be a minimum-cost goal node, and let $n_s$ be a shallowest goal node.

For each of the following, give an expression that characterizes the set of nodes that are explored before the search terminates.
For instance, if we asked for the set of nodes with positive heuristic value, you could say: for all $n$, such that $h(n) \geq 0$. Don't worry about ties (so you wonâ€™t need to worry about $>$ versus $\geq$). If there are no nodes for which the expression is true, you must write ``none.''

Give an inequality in terms of the functions defined above to describe the nodes $n$ that are explored in a breadth-first search before terminating.
