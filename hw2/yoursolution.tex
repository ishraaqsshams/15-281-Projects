\def \Oneh{Inadmissible heuristics are generally easier to compute and are more intuitive than an admissible hueristic. For example, Manhattan distance only takes the distance from a current node to the goal state into consideration, whereas an admissible hueristic takes other factors into account so that the cost is not overestimated.}

\def \SevenAi {This will not necessarily change the path with the new hueristic, but it can change towards favoring paths with lower crime rates. The new path may not be the most optimal in terms of time since we are avoiding routes with higher crime rate even if it is faster to go through them.}
\def \SevenAii {One possible way to avoid paths with higher crime rates is to remove the edges that have high crime rates. This way, the hueristic will not even consider going through those paths.}
\def \SevenAiii {People living in higher crime neighborhoods will now have a harder time navigating, which can stimulate racial biases against people in lower income areas. In addition, firms and businesses that reside in these areas will now experience a fewer number of customers.}
